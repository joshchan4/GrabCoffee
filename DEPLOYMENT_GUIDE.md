---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Commit and Push Frontend Changes to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\gpayu\Grab Coffee\GrabCoffee"

# Check what files have been modified
git status

# Add all the changes we made
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: Stripe payment rounding, OAuth login issues, and app icon configuration

- Fixed amount calculation rounding in CartScreen.js and OrderSummaryScreen.js
- Added fallback amount calculation in backend paymentRoutes.js
- Fixed Google/Apple OAuth session creation in LoginScreen.js and SignupScreen.js
- Updated app.config.js with proper icon paths (icon.png, splash.png, favicon.png)
- Added validation and better error handling for payments
- Resolved missing route parameters when returning from login/signup"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Backend on Render

**Option A: Automatic Deployment (if connected to GitHub)**
- Render should automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub
- Check your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
- Look for your backend service and verify it's redeploying

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "grab-coffee-global" backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

**Verify Backend Deployment:**
```bash
# Test the backend is running
curl https://grab-coffee-global.onrender.com/api/payment/health

# If no health endpoint, test with:
curl https://grab-coffee-global.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Build for iOS App Store Connect & TestFlight

```bash
# Option A: Use our prepared script
./fix-icon.bat

# Option B: Manual commands
# Clear Expo cache (use npx expo instead of expo)
npx expo start --clear

# Build for production with cleared cache
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

**Monitor the Build:**
1. Command will show a build URL (like: https://expo.dev/accounts/[username]/projects/grabcoffee/builds/[build-id])
2. Open the URL to monitor build progress
3. Build typically takes 15-30 minutes

### Step 4: Submit to App Store Connect

**Once EAS build completes:**

1. **Download the .ipa file** from the EAS build dashboard
2. **Upload to App Store Connect:**
   - Use Xcode's Organizer, or
   - Use Application Loader, or
   - Use Transporter app from Mac App Store

**Alternative - Direct EAS Submit:**
```bash
# After build completes, submit directly
npx eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

### Step 5: Configure TestFlight

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. **Navigate to**: Your App ‚Üí TestFlight
3. **Find your new build** (may take 10-20 minutes to process)
4. **Add Test Information:**
   - What to Test: "Fixed payment rounding issues, OAuth login problems, and app icon display"
   - Add your email to Internal Testing

### Step 6: Test the Fixed Issues

**Once available in TestFlight:**

1. **Test Icon**: ‚úÖ Should show your coffee app icon instead of white screen
2. **Test OAuth Login**: ‚úÖ Google/Apple login should work without "session creation" errors
3. **Test Payments**: ‚úÖ Order an Iced Americano - $6.21 should stay $6.21 (no rounding to $6.22)

## üéØ Quick Command Summary

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add . && git commit -m "Fix Stripe rounding, OAuth login, and app icon issues" && git push origin main

# 2. Build for iOS (with cache clearing) - Skip cache clearing for now
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache

# 3. Submit to App Store (after build completes)
npx eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Expo CLI Issue
If you encounter "legacy expo-cli" warnings, that's normal. The EAS build command will work fine.
The Stripe plugin was temporarily removed from config to avoid build conflicts - your Stripe payments will still work.

## üö® Troubleshooting

**If Backend Deployment Fails:**
- Check Render logs for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify the GitHub repository is connected

**If iOS Build Fails:**
- Check EAS build logs
- Ensure Apple Developer account is properly configured
- Verify certificates and provisioning profiles

**If Icons Still Don't Work:**
- Verify icon.png is exactly 1024x1024 pixels
- Check the file isn't corrupted
- Try rebuilding with `--clear-cache` again

## üìû Need Help?

If any step fails, check:
1. **EAS Build Logs**: For build-specific errors
2. **Render Logs**: For backend deployment issues  
3. **App Store Connect**: For submission problems
4. **TestFlight**: For testing and distribution issues

All three major issues should be resolved with this deployment! üéâ
